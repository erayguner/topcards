## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**ðŸš¨ DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send vulnerability details to the repository maintainer
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact [@erayguner](https://github.com/erayguner) directly

### What to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios  
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Affected versions, configurations, or environments
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code (if applicable)

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timeline
4. **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

This project implements several security measures:

#### Infrastructure Security
- âœ… **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using Google Cloud KMS
- âœ… **Network Security**: Private subnets with restricted access
- âœ… **IAM**: Least privilege access controls
- âœ… **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- âœ… **Secret Management**: Google Secret Manager integration

#### Code Security
- âœ… **Secret Scanning**: Multiple tools (TruffleHog, Gitleaks, Semgrep)
- âœ… **Dependency Scanning**: OWASP dependency vulnerability checks
- âœ… **Infrastructure Scanning**: Checkov, TFSec, Terrascan
- âœ… **Container Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability assessments
- âœ… **License Compliance**: Automated license validation

#### Development Security
- âœ… **Automated Scanning**: Pre-commit and CI/CD security checks
- âœ… **Code Review**: Required reviews for all changes
- âœ… **Branch Protection**: Protected main branch with required checks
- âœ… **SARIF Integration**: Security findings in GitHub Security tab

## Security Configurations

### Required Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are properly configured:

```bash
# Google Cloud Project Configuration
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_REGION=us-central1

# Terraform Backend (if using remote state)
TF_VAR_project_id=your-project-id
```

### Terraform Security

#### Secure State Management
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    prefix = "terraform/state"
  }
}
```

#### KMS Encryption
All sensitive data is encrypted using Google Cloud KMS:
```hcl
resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "terraform_state_bucket" {
  name     = "terraform-state-bucket"
  key_ring = google_kms_key_ring.terraform.id
}
```

### Network Security

#### Private Subnets
```hcl
resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "private" {
  name          = "private-subnet"
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.1.0/24"
  region        = var.region
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc.id
  
  private_ip_google_access = true
}
```

#### Firewall Rules
Minimal firewall rules with explicit deny-all default:
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "deny_all" {
  name    = "deny-all"
  network = google_compute_network.vpc.name
  
  deny {
    protocol = "all"
  }
  
  priority = 65534
}
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 1-5**: Initial assessment and triage
- **Day 5-30**: Investigation and fix development
- **Day 30-90**: Coordinated disclosure and patch release

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:

1. **Critical**: Immediate patch release
2. **High**: Patch within 7 days
3. **Medium**: Patch within 30 days  
4. **Low**: Included in next regular release

## Compliance

- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Infrastructure security standards
- **Google Cloud Security**: Best practices and recommendations
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls framework

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

```yaml
# Security scanning tools
- TruffleHog: Secret detection
- Gitleaks: Git secret scanning  
- Semgrep: Code security analysis
- Checkov: Infrastructure security
- TFSec: Terraform security
- Terrascan: Policy as code
- OWASP Dependency Check: Vulnerability scanning
```

### Manual Security Reviews

- **Quarterly**: Infrastructure security review
- **Per Release**: Security-focused code review
- **Annual**: Third-party security assessment

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
